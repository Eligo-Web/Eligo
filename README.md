Eligo is a web application primarily used for in-class polls. Students can go to eligo.cs.jhu.edu on their phones or laptop during class and participate in in-class polls. Students can also use physical iClicker remotes to participate in in-class polls. Eligo offers live charts to instructors during a poll and stores detailed analytics following the poll. These detailed analytics include but are not limited to students’ name and email as well as all of their choices prior to their final answer with appropriate timestamps. Overall, Eligo has three main goals:

1. Provide an intuitive and simple web user interface to students and instructors during class polls as well as enabling students to participate using physical iClickers
2. Deliver detailed analytics of students’ responses to instructors
3. Provide high-performance, meaningful live charts during polls to instructors and to students, upon instructor’s permission
